Modern multi-author publishing for WordPress.

== Description ==

Assign multiple bylines to posts, pages, and any custom post type that supports authors. Create guest bylines for contributors who don't need WordPress user accounts.

On the frontend, use the template tags to list bylines anywhere you'd normally list the post author.

== Installation ==

The Bylines plugin can be installed much like any other WordPress plugin.

1. Upload the plugin ZIP archive file via "Plugins" -> "Add New" in the WordPress admin, or extract the files and upload them via FTP.
2. Activate the Bylines plugin through the "Plugins" list in the WordPress admin.

Integrate the template tags into your theme to display assigned bylines on the frontend.

== WP-CLI Commands ==

This plugin implements a variety of [WP-CLI](https://wp-cli.org) commands. All commands are grouped into the `wp byline` namespace.

    $ wp help byline
